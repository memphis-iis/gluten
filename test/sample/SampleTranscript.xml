KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:00:00]  confused on the gallons
[00:00:06] hello

You
[00:00:10] Hello, Welcome to example.org!
[00:00:12] hi

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:00:18] my file didnt up;load

You
[00:00:36] no, I don&apos;t see it either...
[00:01:24] You can try again.  It can also work during session.  Many students do this...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:01:36] File Shared &gt; 9.jpg
[00:01:42] ok
[00:01:45] there is it

You
[00:01:47] ok
[00:02:38] Alright... Let me draw a picture first.  That usually helps...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:02:54] ok
[00:04:28] I&apos;m following...

You
[00:04:48] ok so what we have is something that is varying over time...
[00:05:02] That is the key point to understand in the beginning

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:05:25] ok
[00:05:38] I&apos;m following...

You
[00:05:57] So if say it flowed for 3 minutes, how much additional water would that put in?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:06:10] 33

You
[00:06:18] right, you understand... :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:06:25] cause it 11 a min

You
[00:06:28] how did you get that?
[00:06:31] correct

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:06:34] :)

You
[00:06:42] So then we go from that to general equation
[00:07:00] for any t, how much water flow in , over t minutes?
[00:07:30] This is similar to D = RT
[00:07:48] Here, we have Volume = R T

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:07:48] ok

You
[00:08:06] So when t is 3
[00:08:13] you know that 33 gals flowed in

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:08:14] I&apos;m following...
[00:08:24] correct

You
[00:08:55] agree?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:09:01] yes

You
[00:09:35] ok so what is the rate of increase then?  what is the general formula for the increase?
[00:09:54] if t is 5?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:10:19] ok

You
[00:10:26] This is like the slope on the line

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:10:26] 55

You
[00:10:30] right...
[00:10:44] So the greater the t, the higher that moves the volume
[00:10:52] So this is like the slope on line
[00:11:14] At 0 time (t = 0) what is the volume?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:11:30] correct
[00:11:37] 0

You
[00:11:46] are you sure?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:11:52] because 0 x 11 is 0

You
[00:11:58] ok, that is true
[00:12:05] but please look back at text..

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:12:10] ok

You
[00:12:15] first sentence

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:12:16] let me reread it
[00:13:20] hmm
[00:13:45] Im sorry you loist me
[00:13:48] on this one&apos;

You
[00:13:55] like when you fill your gas tank... Is it always at 0 when you start?
[00:14:12] the rate of flow may be 5 gals/min on a gas pump
[00:14:22] but your tank already has some in it at beginning
[00:14:37] So V(0) is not equal to 0

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:14:45] ok

You
[00:14:47] It already had 165 gals in it

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:14:58] so would it be 165

You
[00:15:10] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:15:13] since tht what it starts at

You
[00:15:18] right :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:15:27] I got it! Thanks!

You
[00:15:28] What would the y intercept be?
[00:15:37] (the V intercept)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:15:56] 0

You
[00:16:05] when t = 0?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:16:22] hmmm

You
[00:16:58] you can put t into the equation now also
[00:17:01] that will tell you
[00:17:09] so could put 0 in  for t

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:18:21] ok

You
[00:18:26] Not meaning to confuse, I know the question didn&apos;t ask for that...
[00:18:32] but they are the same

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:18:45] k
[00:18:51] thats for explaining

You
[00:18:51] So the line crosses y axis at 165

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:18:55] right
[00:19:11] thanks for explaining

You
[00:19:14] Did you want to work another?
[00:19:17] or all for now?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:19:26] yes please

You
[00:19:32] I see that you have a paid contract with us...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:19:32] but real quick

You
[00:19:34] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:19:54] I just want to confirm that the final answe
[00:19:58] on no

You
[00:20:02] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:20:01] you erased it
[00:20:05] lol

You
[00:20:21] I added a second window
[00:20:25] that is what happened
[00:20:33] and it scrolls up automatically

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:20:35] how do I see the 1st
[00:20:50] ah ha
[00:20:51] see it
[00:21:02] v=165 + 11 A

You
[00:21:17] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:21:31] ok
[00:21:39] here is my second problem
[00:22:19] File Shared &gt; 10.jpg
[00:22:42] now how I figured this anser

You
[00:22:52] yes that is correct, 27 x^6

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:22:57] is that I multiply
[00:23:02] and add the exponents
[00:23:05] good
[00:23:07] thanks
[00:23:08] David

You
[00:23:09] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:23:10] lol
[00:23:16] just wanted to double check

You
[00:23:20] sure

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:23:19] ok last one
[00:23:26] I know you have to get to other studebts
[00:23:29] I will be quick

You
[00:23:38] you have contract with us,

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:23:44] File Shared &gt; 11.jpg

You
[00:23:45] so you can stay as long as want

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:23:53] oh really

You
[00:24:03] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:24:04] all the other tutors say I have to go
[00:24:17] because they have other students in line
[00:24:22] YOU ROCK! David

You
[00:24:25] My information says that you are what is called a consumer session
[00:24:44] which means unlimited time

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:24:51] they make me log back in and its ok because I understand but it just sucks starting all over
[00:24:53] lol
[00:25:04] well you will get an excellent rating fron me tonight

You
[00:25:20] It does depend on how you are accessing our service, though

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:25:21] I rarely give them! Only when earned
[00:25:27] oh
[00:25:28] ok
[00:25:50] well perfect
[00:26:06] ok well as long as you dont mind I do a 4 more

You
[00:26:08] to go through a library link I think would be a limited session...
[00:26:14] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:26:13] hmmm
[00:26:15] o
[00:26:16] ok
[00:26:22] alright
[00:26:25] well lets see

You
[00:26:25] basically free to the public

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:26:33] hmmm
[00:26:35] good to knpw
[00:26:37] knpw

You
[00:26:37] but we have to limit it

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:26:41] perfect

You
[00:26:48] for that reason, others on queue

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:26:54] thanks David! :) you made my night

You
[00:26:57] ok this problem...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:27:04] Ive been struggling in math
[00:27:15] so this really helps with the consistancy
[00:27:27] of  the same tutor
[00:27:29] ok
[00:27:42] so for this one
[00:27:46] I subtracted
[00:28:50] is this right

You
[00:28:52] I imagine somehow someone has purchased a contract with example.org, which gives you this, through your company, or some other way...
[00:29:06] not quite

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:29:13] ok well I am happy

You
[00:29:17] heree, you need to insert 24 for x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:29:20] that we can work on few more
[00:29:29] I have 4 more after this

You
[00:29:32] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:29:34] aww shucks
[00:29:40] ok what did I do wrong

You
[00:30:08] Like if this is a function, if this is f(x) = x + 7
[00:30:18] and we substitute 24 for x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:30:28] ok

You
[00:30:51] so 31...
[00:31:06] Yes that is immportant property of functions,

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:31:06] ok

You
[00:31:25] once you know it you can calculate other points, given a certain x
[00:31:39] make sense?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:32:03] yes

You
[00:32:45] It just becomes confusing if don&apos;t use a different page when pasting...
[00:32:52] that is why I am doing this...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:33:29] well trying to remember all of the rulea
[00:33:37] rules confusing
[00:33:43] to me
[00:33:52] ok here is the other one
[00:34:40] File Shared &gt; 12.jpg
[00:35:20] fractions are so confusing to me

You
[00:36:04] they are difficult for many students I have seen...
[00:36:24] OK so first what is the formula we use?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:37:12] now what I think we are suppose to do multiply 2 X 4 +3

You
[00:37:27] oh, yes
[00:37:34] to get the numerator...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:38:00] ok
[00:38:08] so Im on the right path

You
[00:38:12] and the reason for that is, because we have two whole numbers
[00:38:21] and each whole has 4 of the fourths

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:38:24] oh ok

You
[00:38:28] so we multiply 2 by 4
[00:38:32] then add in the part

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:38:48] hmmmm
[00:38:49] ok
[00:39:26] so now we add
[00:39:28] ?

You
[00:39:32] not quite
[00:39:38] we have to calculate area...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:39:38] ok

You
[00:39:50] so we use that formula

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:39:51] alright

You
[00:40:34] So we fill in the values, same as filling in the 24 for x
[00:40:54] I got this from the Hint...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:41:00] so the bh
[00:41:16] is what I circled

You
[00:41:38] i see...
[00:41:40] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:41:54] so now I multiply to figure out the area

You
[00:41:55] the circle did not appear till after you mentioned it

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:42:04] oh ok
[00:42:08] no worries

You
[00:42:16] you fill in the values, substituting the values into the formula
[00:42:38] oh that is jsut due to internet I am sure...
[00:42:58] so you fill in the values for that formula...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:43:25] like that?

You
[00:43:38] correct, exactly :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:43:44] YAHOOOO!
[00:43:51] Im on a roll now!

You
[00:43:58] yes :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:44:01] next step?
[00:44:05] lol

You
[00:44:14] now the multiplication

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:44:15] Do I add them together
[00:44:20] aww shucks
[00:44:25] ok so multiply

You
[00:44:28] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:44:30] ok
[00:44:34] give me a sec

You
[00:45:11] Actually that is how the formula was derived...
[00:45:24] each triangle is one half of a rectangle

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:45:29] ok
[00:45:40] so I just right it down like that

You
[00:45:44] So it is not as mysterious as it may seem

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:45:46] and that is the final step
[00:45:53] or I solve it

You
[00:45:54] It needs to be calculated

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:45:59] ok

You
[00:46:03] It should come out to a single fraction
[00:46:13] so cancellation if you can

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:47:01] I think I did this wrong

You
[00:47:05] that also could be done, to cancel the 4&apos;s
[00:47:14] It is correct, just needs to be reduced

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:47:23] by 4

You
[00:47:25] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:47:28] ok

You
[00:47:53] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:47:58] :)
[00:48:02] I feel great
[00:48:05] Im getting it
[00:48:08] Yeah

You
[00:48:14] yes;)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:48:20] so that is it right were done
[00:48:23] for this one

You
[00:48:24] It is a matter of understandig the formula
[00:48:29] and plugging values in
[00:48:34] yes is correct

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:48:34] yes and this is wear I get confused
[00:48:43] with all of the different rules
[00:48:47] and formulas
[00:49:04] were done right

You
[00:49:15] yes this problem finished
[00:49:19] the 11 is a prime numbe
[00:49:53] That is how you can tell also, if the numerator or denominator is prime
[00:49:57] you know it is finished
[00:50:07] but that doesn&apos;t always happen

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:50:16] the base number is wgat you mean by prime?

You
[00:50:31] like that

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:50:37] File Shared &gt; 13.jpg

You
[00:50:44] nothing will divide into those numbers

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:50:53] makes sense
[00:50:55] thanks

You
[00:51:26] ok I will make another board, larger...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:51:33] ok

You
[00:53:04] the f(x) is the y direction...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:53:10] I&apos;m following...

You
[00:53:18] So if x is 0, what is y?
[00:53:28] if insert 0 for x?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:53:46] 0

You
[00:53:54] not quite...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:54:10] 1

You
[00:54:13] -3 times 0?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:54:20] graphs get me every time
[00:54:25] geez

You
[00:54:29] the numbers...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:54:32] -0

You
[00:54:36] That is what to concentrate on...
[00:55:03] 0 times anything is 0, right?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:55:15] correct

You
[00:55:36] ok so if x is 0, we plot on 5
[00:56:07] That is called the y intercept, you may have heard that

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:56:24] yes I have
[00:56:37] the line where y is
[00:57:09] got it

You
[00:57:16] yes, like the axle on a car
[00:57:20] same root word

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:57:44] cool

You
[00:57:47] It is the start of the coordinates...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:57:56] ok

You
[00:58:08] So then What does your teacher say to do, use the slope to calculate another point?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:58:43] y=mx+b

You
[00:58:51] right...:)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:58:54] YAHOO
[00:58:56] :)

You
[00:59:02] so what is b here?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[00:59:33] this is tricky for me
[00:59:49] I always get it wrong

You
[01:00:05] Is ok it is a matter of understanding the pattern

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:00:06] now I know the formula but when it is time to use it I get confused
[01:01:04] b= 5

You
[01:01:09] right:)
[01:01:37] yes if is in this form of y = mx + b, then the b is the lone number, and it is the y intercept

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:01:38] I just cant remember if it is Y or x
[01:01:49] vertical or horzontal
[01:01:52] on the graph

You
[01:01:57] x always horizontal

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:02:17] right ther

You
[01:03:07] not quite
[01:03:19] If you want the x intercept...
[01:03:28] what is y at the x intercept?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:03:42] it is positive right

You
[01:03:54] at x intercept, the x axis itself...
[01:03:58] what is y there?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:04:02] 0

You
[01:04:05] correct:)
[01:04:20] so suppose you put in 0 for y in the formula?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:04:29] ok

You
[01:05:06] Then the relation y = -3x + 5 will tell us what x must be
[01:05:29] following?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:05:35] I&apos;m following...
[01:06:08] 8x

You
[01:06:48] So if solving for x...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:06:54] we add

You
[01:07:02] we are solving for x...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:07:14] -8x
[01:07:16] I mean
[01:07:22] since it is negative
[01:07:43] nope
[01:07:49] wait

You
[01:07:50] not quite, ok solving for x, we want x by itself... What we are doing is USING the formula

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:07:56] I just re added it and it is 2x
[01:08:13] oh
[01:08:15] I see
[01:08:28] we add -3x to both sided
[01:08:32] sides

You
[01:08:40] could do that, yes
[01:09:09] So x = ?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:09:34] I cant see that
[01:09:39] what are those

You
[01:10:06] I added 3x to both sides
[01:10:15] so now we have 3x = 5

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:10:32] oh
[01:10:33] ok

You
[01:10:55] So then we solve for x....

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:11:10] 3 cdant go into 5
[01:11:17] so we make it a fraction
[01:11:27] right?

You
[01:11:36] right, we want x by itself
[01:11:44] So we want 1x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:12:02] oh because we cnclled out 3 x

You
[01:12:27] the 3x =5 is correct

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:12:38] got it

You
[01:12:39] now if 3 times something is 5

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:12:46] so that is the final answer
[01:12:59] or we have another stpe

You
[01:13:12] x = 5/3
[01:13:20] that is the x intercept

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:13:27] oh so I had it backward
[01:13:42] that is what it should be

You
[01:13:44] yes
[01:13:50] yes for the x intercept

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:13:50] oh ok

You
[01:14:14] It doesn&apos;t have to be done,  but you will certainly do this later in your course, so the time is not wasted
[01:14:35] We could use the slope, though, to calculate another point

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:14:46] so wait is 5/3 my final answer or 3x+5
[01:14:50] wait
[01:14:59]  I meanb 3x=5

You
[01:15:29] The goal was to graph the function, right?
[01:15:47] This is one way to do it, to plot both x and y intercepts
[01:15:59] We just calculated x intercept

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:16:33] ohhh
[01:17:16] so now we \
[01:17:26] add on graph

You
[01:17:30] yes
[01:17:52] yes :)  because we have to have at least two points

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:18:04] like tha

You
[01:18:12] the second line not correct
[01:18:20] the 5,0 not on the line...
[01:18:35] ctrl -z also
[01:18:37] will undo

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:18:55] cool

You
[01:19:33] We can also down three and over 1
[01:19:36] the slope...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:19:49] so is that line correct

You
[01:20:01] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:20:13] so we go up 5 over 3

You
[01:20:27] The slope is the m
[01:20:33] that tells how steep it is
[01:20:38] So what is m here?
[01:20:59] Don&apos;t get me wrong, the graph is correct
[01:21:07] just wanting to explain about slope...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:21:28] ok

You
[01:21:37] Since the slope is change in y, divided by change in x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:21:48] is that it
[01:21:53] up 5 over 3

You
[01:21:55] then if that slope is large, it is steep
[01:22:42] so if have -3/1...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:22:58] down 3 over 1

You
[01:23:03] right
[01:23:10] that is how got that point
[01:23:15] ok you already understod that

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:23:48] ok
[01:23:52] yes
[01:24:01] I know some of it
[01:24:20] I just get stuck on information overload
[01:24:28] and forget some rules

You
[01:25:04] yes many students get confused by rules

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:25:08] oh
[01:25:11] yeah
[01:25:14] I see why
[01:25:15] ok

You
[01:25:22] but you can also remember  that if x is 0
[01:25:31] then that is why the b is the y intercept

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:25:32] so the 1st point is 0,5

You
[01:25:36] because that part goes to 0
[01:25:52] so then it makes sense
[01:25:55] it is logical

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:25:54] the second is 0,1

You
[01:26:05] 0,2
[01:26:15] sorry, 1,2
[01:26:33] Also that is another way,
[01:26:43] simply put a different x in
[01:26:55] so like use 2 for x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:26:57] Im sorry David what two points should I connect on this graph
[01:27:03] Im confused

You
[01:27:08] (0,5), and (1,2)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:27:43] ok
[01:27:55] just wanted to be clear

You
[01:28:04] (5/3, 0) is also a point on it, but is harder to graph
[01:28:17] So all you do is get the y intercept...
[01:28:31] then use slope to get a second point

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:28:49] yeah I could see why
[01:29:04] the more I do the better I will become
[01:29:10] it just takes practice

You
[01:29:11] yes
[01:29:15] yes definitely

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:29:26] ok let me graph these real quick

You
[01:29:28] it is logical, once you work enough of them

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:29:29] in the meantime
[01:29:38] here is the other problem

You
[01:29:38] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:30:54] File Shared &gt; 14.jpg
[01:31:22] pls give me a sec

You
[01:31:42] ok

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:33:14] ok
[01:33:17] im ready

You
[01:33:23] hi
[01:33:37] ok so what do you think?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:33:43] alright
[01:33:45] so ...
[01:35:05] am I on the right track?

You
[01:35:50] not quite, what they are doing is they have to pay say 500 a month just to keep the lights on in their factory and pay the employees
[01:36:07] Then for each shirt they cost $4 more

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:36:30] I&apos;m following...

You
[01:36:39] Would an illustration help?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:36:45] yes
[01:36:56] Im a visual learner
[01:37:30] is thst the shirtd
[01:37:46] oh ok
[01:37:47] kool

You
[01:39:23] So that is what is going on
[01:39:45] So if they sell no shirts at all they still have to pay 500 dollars

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:39:50] I&apos;m following...

You
[01:40:22] and they also have to pay 4 for EACH shirt.  That is why this is a VARIABLE cost

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:40:36] ok

You
[01:40:54] So if x is the number of shirts, what is their variable cost?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:41:07] x4

You
[01:41:11] right :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:41:16] Yeah!

You
[01:41:18] so that is part of the equation...:)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:41:29] alright

You
[01:41:32] got it!

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:41:46] yup

You
[01:41:55] yes then that 500 is there no matter what
[01:42:26] So what would we do next? to include the 500?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:42:52] +500

You
[01:43:09] yes
[01:43:27] and you know that is correct also because if x is 0, you still have 500 cost

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:43:36] true
[01:44:21] so the cost of producing 6 shirts is x6
[01:44:27] or 4 x 6

You
[01:44:48] ok what is the variable?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:45:34] x
[01:45:36] right

You
[01:45:41] correct ;)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:45:51] so 4x

You
[01:45:54] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:45:56] x4
[01:46:05] is the right way to write it

You
[01:46:11] 4x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:46:29] so why do they have a $
[01:46:31] for the answer
[01:46:41] I have to multiply 4 X 6
[01:46:45] huh?

You
[01:46:48] dollar sign?
[01:47:19] oh did not see that, my fault

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:47:21] the 2nd part of the answer

You
[01:47:39] so again, we use the formula to tell us the answer
[01:47:47] what is the x?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:49:01] the amount of shirts

You
[01:49:02] We talked about it already, so this is not giving you the answer..
[01:49:12] yes, so I substituted the 6 for x

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:49:21] yes
[01:49:28] thats what I thought
[01:49:57] ok so we 4 x 6 = 24
[01:50:11] is the cost of 6 shirts

You
[01:50:13] yes, it is exactly this number

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:50:27] perfect

You
[01:50:29] We replace the x with 6

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:51:26] ok
[01:51:31] well I got it

You
[01:51:40] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:51:44] oh wait
[01:51:54] I didnt see that last part
[01:52:16] so we add 24 + 500

You
[01:52:19] Yes I used the formula directly

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:52:21] to make 524

You
[01:52:23] yes
[01:52:39] Yes that is the way to do it, is like a machine

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:52:41] that is the cost of the total shirts because we have to pay 500 no matter what
[01:52:44] ah ha
[01:52:46] got it

You
[01:52:52] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:52:55] :)
[01:53:00] perfect
[01:53:10] wow that was a trick question
[01:53:16] I would have missed it
[01:53:29] thanks for explaining this in detailed

You
[01:53:37] I guess in real life, though, you don&apos;t incur costs of 500 with each lot
[01:53:47] but this is just an example

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:53:58] true
[01:54:28] it makes you realize that life is not cheap to survive or run a business
[01:54:31] lol

You
[01:54:34] I am not an economist, though...
[01:54:41] yes requires lot of thought and planning

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:54:41] lol
[01:54:47] yup that makes two us

You
[01:55:00] :)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:55:10] ok well this is the last one and then I will let you go

You
[01:55:15] alright...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:55:20] I dont want to keep u too much linger
[01:55:30] I really appreciate this
[01:55:51] File Shared &gt; 15.jpg

You
[01:55:55] Oh, this is how we are instructed to work...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:56:10] well I just feel bad keeping you

You
[01:56:12] to stay with the student for at least the length of our shift...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:56:26] but yet it is better to learb
[01:56:29] learb
[01:56:32] learn
[01:56:42] oh is your shift ended

You
[01:56:43] I am following the rules they told me to do...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:56:46] I wont keep you

You
[01:56:48] not till 11

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:57:00] what time zone are you in
[01:57:07] it is 7:40pm my time

You
[01:57:11] Eastern

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:57:17] ok
[01:57:25] well this is it
[01:57:28] thanks David
[01:57:31] for your patience
[01:57:34] ok

You
[01:57:39] you&apos;re welcome

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:57:49] so lets hurry so you can get off work lol
[01:57:51] :)
[01:58:10] I added you in my favorites so always let me know when your shift is up so I wont keep you pk
[01:58:13] ok
[01:58:15] alright
[01:58:20] here we go

You
[01:58:41] ok you are to use substitution...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:58:52] well kinds
[01:58:55] kinda
[01:59:07] this problem confuese me
[01:59:10] ok

You
[01:59:30] Ok substitution means that you first solve for one variable in one equation
[01:59:41] and then substitute that into the other one

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[01:59:46] ok

You
[02:00:04] This way you eliminate one variable and can solve for the other one

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:00:10] ok

You
[02:00:29] So like in equation 1... if we solved for a...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:00:37] I&apos;m following...

You
[02:01:00] lets solve for b actually, no fractions...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:03:08] thankis for sharinfg the ctrl alt z
[02:03:10] feature
[02:03:11] ok

You
[02:03:18] yes, you &apos;re welcome
[02:03:22] is faster and neater

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:03:26] so we subtract b from both sides
[02:03:28] yes it is

You
[02:04:26] If we subtracted the 5 it would be better, rigth
[02:04:32] then b is more by itself

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:04:34] yes
[02:05:05] oh go ahead
[02:05:06] sorry

You
[02:05:13] please continue
[02:05:21] better if student does work

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:06:06] like that

You
[02:06:22] yes removes that 5

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:06:27] ok
[02:06:49] so thats it
[02:06:52] 0-b
[02:06:57] or we have another step

You
[02:07:26] so now have -b on right
[02:07:32] so is the negative of what we want

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:07:34] yes
[02:07:53] no
[02:08:01] it will become positive

You
[02:08:52] If multiply by -1, that fixes it
[02:08:59] let me show a better way, just a second
[02:09:05] if had added b in beginning

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:09:06] ok
[02:10:12] that does seem easier to read
[02:10:15] and understand

You
[02:10:25] ok so b is 5-5a
[02:10:42] Now we substitute
[02:11:38] make sense?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:11:44] yes
[02:11:58] because 5-5=o

You
[02:12:52] oh, we still have to solve for a

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:12:56] ok

You
[02:13:53] you want to work it?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:13:55] yes we need see if there is a solution
[02:14:02] or ordered pair
[02:14:10] so we work on a next right
[02:14:13] ok

You
[02:14:15] yes

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:14:16] let me try
[02:14:51] is that it

You
[02:15:27] not quite, some confusion somewhere
[02:15:36] we need to perform this algebra

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:15:41] ok

You
[02:15:47] It is not necessarilyh equal to 0

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:15:55] ok

You
[02:16:32] It is just coincidence that they are all 5&apos;s

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:16:59] yes

You
[02:17:01] So distributive property

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:17:05] and thats why I was confuses
[02:17:29] I was looking at the last one you did
[02:17:41] and you 5-5a
[02:17:52] so I tried to do the same thing
[02:18:01] with the second one
[02:18:07] and messed it up
[02:18:14] :(

You
[02:18:29] takes practice, as you said...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:18:37] ok

You
[02:19:42] This is just like taking one piece, the b,
[02:19:57] and completely replacing it with this group, 5-5a
[02:20:01] that is what is happening
[02:21:01] What it is, these are two lines, at different angles that will intersect

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:21:07] ok

You
[02:21:39] -(-5a)

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:21:50] this is so confusing
[02:22:01] but I appreciate your exlaining
[02:22:04] ok

You
[02:22:25] Perhaps  will take some more time to sink in

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:22:32] yeah
[02:22:47] ok
[02:22:57] so what is next

You
[02:23:01] well...
[02:23:13] this is a strange one, not the usual...
[02:23:24] 5a on both sides...
[02:23:28] so what could be done?

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:23:48] oh so  a trick question huh?

You
[02:23:57] that means the 5a is redundant

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:23:58] subtract

You
[02:24:02] correct

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:24:03] yes
[02:24:11] and it cancels out

You
[02:24:17] but...

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:24:21] uh oh

You
[02:24:24] as you ccan see there is a problem

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:24:27] :(

You
[02:24:39] We did calculations correctly

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:24:44] ok

You
[02:24:53] but if examine the first two equations...
[02:25:02] 5a = 5-b
[02:25:04] and
[02:25:16] 5a also equals 3 - b
[02:25:24] but that is not possible

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:25:26] yes I see
[02:25:47] hmmm yeah I really am confused on this one
[02:25:54] but go ahead
[02:26:00] keep teaching

You
[02:26:09] we did substitution correctly, so please don&apos;t be confused by that

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:26:15] ok good

You
[02:26:29] But this just proves that there is no solution to this system

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:26:47] because it is redundant
[02:26:54] and we cant find an asnwer

You
[02:27:09] There are no two numbers a and b in which 5a = 5-b
[02:27:15] and at same time

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:27:22] right to equal a point

You
[02:27:24] 5a = 3-b
[02:27:43] If on x-y plane, these would be parallel lines
[02:27:47] never intersect
[02:28:02] But bottom line is when get contradiction
[02:28:14] and you know you performed the substitution correctly

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:28:16] oh wow

You
[02:28:20] then you know there is no solution

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:28:32] well thanks because I was really worried I goofed it up
[02:28:37] perfect
[02:28:59] well David you have been incredible tonight
[02:29:07] I want to send you my deepest appreciation for your teaching and patience
[02:29:14] I know you have to go now

You
[02:29:17] you worked hard and were attentive also..

KIMBERLY (Customer)
[02:29:17] but thanks a million
[02:29:23] I will see you again soon
