# IMPORTANT!!!!

This legacy folder is a clone of the original SVN-controlled Annotator 1.0
project created as part of the ADL-Tutor.com joint grant. It is maintained
here for legacy purposes. However, at this point it should not be used.

# Original README

This is a Maven-based project which requires Java 7 and assumes a deployment
to Tomcat 7 (although any Servlet 3.0 container should suffice)

Please see the Maven-generated site for further introduction and details.  The
Maven site is created as part of the dev server build, so you should be able
to see it at http://iistdc-dev.memphis.edu
