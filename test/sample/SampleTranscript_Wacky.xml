Ashley (Customer)
[00:00:00] If you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with ____ force.   equal   less   more   no
 
You
[00:00:08] Hello!
[00:00:11] How are you?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:00:36] nervous I have this quiz and I am not sure if my answers are correct
 
You
[00:00:59] ok, I can check them for you
[00:01:05] what did you think about this one?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:01:11] equal
[00:01:25] for the one above
 
You
[00:01:28] yep
[00:01:32] good job
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:01:44] Two identical small cars (car A &amp; car B) have a head-on collision. Which scenario is true?
Car A exerts a greater force on car B than car B exerts on car A.
Car B exerts a greater force on car A than car A exerts on car B.
The force that car A exerts on car B and the force that car B exerts on car A are the same magnitude.
 
You
[00:02:12] ok
[00:02:15] what do you think?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:02:19] I think it is the third one
[00:02:26] the force...
 
You
[00:02:33] you are correct
[00:02:35]  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:02:47] The attractive force that acts between all objects is the
electromagnetic force
gravitational force
strong nuclear force
weak nuclear force

[00:02:59] gravitational force
 
You
[00:03:15] correct again
[00:03:18] you&apos;re doing great
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:03:32] If the weight of an object of mass &quot;m&quot; is &quot;mg&quot;; then the weight of an object of mass &quot;2m&quot; is
mg/2.
mg.
2mg.
4mg.
[00:03:54] i think this on is mg/2
 
You
[00:04:29] not quite
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:04:44] is is 2mg them
[00:04:46] then
 
You
[00:05:00] yes is it. does that make sense to you?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:05:14] i get those two calculations mixed up
 
You
[00:05:42] think of it conceptually, if an object has more mass it has more weight
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:05:47] Resistance of mass to a change in state of motion is the objects_______
acceleration.
force.
inertia
velocity.
[00:05:49] ok
[00:06:12] this one i think is velocity
 
You
[00:06:55] velocity is just how fast something is moving. 
[00:07:00] any other ideas?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:07:13] force
[00:07:25] wait 
[00:07:33] isn&apos;t that its acceleration
[00:07:40] because the object is moving?
 
You
[00:08:28] acceleration is the rate at which an objects speed changes. force it what causes it to move
[00:08:32] one guess left....
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:08:39] inertia
 
You
[00:08:41] yes
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:08:52] oh ok
 
You
[00:09:09] inertia is related to mass...it&apos;s what makes an object lazy and not want to change it&apos;s motion
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:09:24] ohhhhh ok i get it
[00:09:26] A bat hits a ball; which has the greater acceleration, the bat or the ball?
The bat because it has a larger mass than the ball.
The ball because it has a smaller mass than the bat.
Although the ball has a smaller mass than the bat, they both have the same magnitude of acceleration.

[00:09:55] I think they both have the same acceleration
 
You
[00:10:41] let me ask this...what do you know about the force each hits the other with?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:11:19] the smaller the greater force
[00:11:27] so it would be the ball then
 
You
[00:12:21] it is the ball. but it&apos;s because they each hit the other with an equal force. F=ma so m(bat)a(bat)=m(ball)a(ball)
[00:12:45] since m(bat) is larger, a(bat) has to be smaller for the two sides to be equal
[00:12:48] does that make sense?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:12:55] sye
[00:12:57] yes
[00:13:09] Newton&apos;s Second Law of Motion states:
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
A body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
A body will move with uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
The force acting on a body equals the rate of change of momentum.
 
You
[00:13:10] great
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:14:20] I am stuck on this one, but my thought was the first one
[00:14:38] for every action...
 
You
[00:14:49] that is the 3rd law
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:14:53] oh
 
You
[00:15:02] i&apos;m not sure about this one
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:15:14] well here is his second law
 
You
[00:15:23] the 2nd and 3rd both sound like the 1st law
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:15:39] the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables
 
You
[00:15:47] so that leaves the 4th...but that is phrased different
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:16:14] - the net force acting upon an object and the mass of the object
 
You
[00:16:20] technically the momentum is changing though
[00:16:26] it&apos;s got to be the 4th one
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:16:29] oh 
 
You
[00:16:42] here is why....
[00:17:50] have you learned about impulse?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:18:37] briefly
[00:18:53] but he said we will get into that in January
 
You
[00:19:10] hmm, well it has to do with force so I&apos;m guess that is where he was going on this one
[00:19:14] that was a tricky one
[00:19:24] i would just do process of elimation
[00:19:34] since we knew the other 3 were different laws
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:19:44] ok
[00:19:46] Cart A and cart B are moving towards each another. They collide and come to rest at the point of impact. From this observation we can conclude that the carts
have equal masses.
were moving with equal and opposite momentum.
were moving with equal and opposite velocities.
were moving with equal kinetic energies.
 
You
[00:20:35] ok
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:20:38] were moving with masses
[00:20:59] or was it with equal kinetic energies
 
You
[00:21:08] neither  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:21:30] darn
 
You
[00:21:38] the mass could be the same but if the velocity was different it wouldn&apos;t work
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:21:38] then would it be the momentum
 
You
[00:21:41] yep
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:21:59] ok i can see that now
 
You
[00:22:00] kinetic energy is close, but his doesn&apos;t say magnitude so it means the same direction
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:22:16] ahhhh ok i get that
[00:22:28] Whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts a force of the same magnitude on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
Always true
Always false
Sometimes true
[00:22:56] that is sometimes true right?
 
You
[00:23:10] can you think of an exception?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:24:29] when they have different masses
[00:24:43] which causes the collision to be different
 
You
[00:25:40] if the mass is not the same, the acceleration is different also to balance it out
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:26:02] oh 
[00:26:29] so then it can&apos;t be true
 
You
[00:26:40] i would say this one is always true
[00:26:46] this is newton&apos;s 3rd law
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:26:52] oh
 
You
[00:27:01] does that make sense?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:27:18] yes now looking at that law, that is true
 
You
[00:27:30]  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:27:32] i wrote the laws down in my notes
[00:27:35] Andrew Haber is an astronaut in space, far away from gravitational and frictional forces. He throws a tennis ball. The ball will
come back to him.
gradually come to rest.
continue to move in a straight line with uniform velocity.
come to rest abruptly.
[00:28:39] woulldn&apos;t it gradually come to a rest since their is no gravity
 
You
[00:28:56] think newton&apos;s 3rd law...
[00:29:02] no gravity means no forces
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:29:24] oh it woudl come back to him
 
You
[00:29:40] what would make it come back to him?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:30:08] the force that was given from andrew
[00:30:20] the ball would pull back on to him
[00:30:39] and the interaction the ball had with andrew 
 
You
[00:31:24] his mass isn&apos;t large enough to do that. he throws it (giving an initial force) but as soon as it leaves his hand there are no forces acting on it
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:31:53] so would it keep moving
 
You
[00:31:59] yes
[00:32:05] you ok with that?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:32:09] yes
[00:32:37] As the distance between an object and the center of the Earth is increased?
the object&apos;s mass decreases and its weight remains the same.
both the object&apos;s mass and its weight remain the same.
both the object&apos;s mass and its weight decrease.
the object&apos;s mass remains the same and its weight decreases.
[00:33:26] wouldn&apos;t the mass and weight decrease
 
You
[00:34:01] mass never changes...no matter where in the universe something is
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:34:13] but the weight will
 
You
[00:34:17] yes
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:34:28] so it will decrease
 
You
[00:34:33] yep  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:34:46] An iron bar has more mass than a plastic bar of the same volume. So the iron bar will have greater inertia.
True
False
 
You
[00:35:14] what do you think?
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:35:15] false
[00:35:52] wait that is a true statement
 
You
[00:35:57] it&apos;s actually true. more mass=greater inertia. think about trying to push an elephant and an mouse with the same force 
[00:36:00] right  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:36:04] sorry was looking at the wrong question
 
You
[00:36:09]  
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:36:18] In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved.
[00:36:28] this one i think is false
 
You
[00:37:30] it is actually true
[00:37:39] kinetic energy is not conserved, but momentum is
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:37:54] oh ok i understand
[00:38:05] The acceleration produced by a net force on a body is inversely proportional to the mass of the body.
True
False
[00:38:25] this one I am not sure
[00:39:11] i think it is False
 
You
[00:39:14] this is just F=ma....since it is ma they are inversely proportional...as one goes up the other goes down
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:39:48] so it is true them
[00:39:49] then
 
You
[00:39:51] right
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:40:02] An object at rest has no net force acting on it.
[00:40:04] this is true
 
You
[00:40:12] yep
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:40:23] The following force diagram represents Newton’s Third Law of Motion. 
[00:40:47] is that true
 
You
[00:41:03] what is the diagram of?
[00:41:07] i think it is true though...
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:42:07] it is just a box with the normal force (UP) and gravitational force going down on the box
[00:42:42] ok 
 
You
[00:42:45] then yes
[00:42:52] true
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:43:04] Also, i am terrible at math and I was hoping that you might be able to help me on them
 
You
[00:43:55] we&apos;re nearly out of time. You&apos;d probably be better off doing them with a new tutor who can stay with you the whole time
 
Ashley (Customer)
[00:44:07] ok thanks for your help
 
You
[00:44:11] no problem
